ADDITIONAL RULES:

- Treat all work as lab-based, academic, or simulated unless explicitly stated otherwise.
- Do NOT claim production SOC, MSSP, or enterprise incident response experience.
- Frame experience using SOC workflows: detection, triage, investigation, escalation, documentation.
- Prioritize evidence derived from labs, PCAPs, logs, configurations, or observable system behavior.
- Avoid tool-name dumping; explain what the tool enabled or revealed.
- Prefer endpoint behavior, DNS, HTTP, TCP session analysis over payload reverse engineering.
- Assume an interviewer will ask “How do you know?” for every bullet.
- If a claim cannot be defended with a command, PCAP, log, or lab output, exclude it.
- Optimize language for SOC Analyst I, NOC Analyst, Junior Cybersecurity Analyst roles.
- Use clear, concise bullets suitable for a one-page resume.
