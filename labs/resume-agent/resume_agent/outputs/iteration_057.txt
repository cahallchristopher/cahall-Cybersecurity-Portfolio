### Explanation of Changes
- **Alignment with SOC Workflows**: The revised bullets now explicitly frame the work using SOC workflows, including detection, triage, investigation, and documentation. This aligns directly with the role's responsibilities in monitoring, investigating, and responding to security alerts.
  
- **Focus on Lab-Based Experience**: All experience is presented as lab-based or simulated, ensuring no claims are made about production environments.

- **Use of SOC-Specific Terminology**: Keywords related to SOC practices such as "Incident Triage," "Threat Detection," and "Log Analysis" have been incorporated. These terms are directly relevant to the role's responsibilities and make it clear that the candidate has experience in these areas.

- **Clarity and Precision**: The language is clearer, more precise, and avoids buzzwords. Each bullet provides specific actions and outcomes, making them defensible if an interviewer asks for evidence or examples.

By focusing on structured, lab-based experience and aligning with SOC-specific terminology and workflows, the revised resume ensures that it meets the technical expectations of a junior cybersecurity analyst role while maintaining strict adherence to the provided constraints.
