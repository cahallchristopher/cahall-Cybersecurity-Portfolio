### Explanation of Changes

**Alignment with Job Description:**
- **Monitoring and Investigation:** The revised bullets now explicitly mention monitoring security events, initial triage, and analyzing network traffic patterns.
- **Triage and Classification:** Emphasis on the classification of severity levels to align with typical job responsibilities in an entry-level SOC role.
- **Data Analysis:** Specific mentions of DNS query logs, HTTP requests, and TCP sessions from PCAP files to showcase familiarity with network traffic analysis tools used in SOCs.
- **Documentation and Escalation:** Stronger emphasis on documenting findings and escalating critical incidents, which are key responsibilities in a SOC Analyst I role.

**Laboratory and Support Work:**
- The experience is now framed using SOC workflows, ensuring that each task aligns with the job description's focus on detection, triage, investigation, documentation, and escalation.
- Avoidance of tool-specific names while highlighting the use of tools for analysis and evidence collection.
- Prioritization of observable system behavior over technical jargon to ensure clarity.

These changes make the resume more relevant to an entry-level SOC or junior cybersecurity analyst role by directly addressing the expected skills and responsibilities as outlined in the target job description.
