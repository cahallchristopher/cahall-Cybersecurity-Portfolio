### Explanation of Changes

**Revised Resume Bullets:**
- **Alignment with Job Description**: The revised bullets now directly address the responsibilities outlined in the target job description, emphasizing monitoring, triage, and investigation tasks.
- **SOC Workflows**: By framing work in terms of SOC workflows like detection, triage, investigation, documentation, and escalation, the experience is presented as directly relevant to an entry-level SOC Analyst role.
- **Evidence-Based Claims**: Each bullet includes specific actions that can be substantiated with lab outputs or logs, such as "collected relevant system configurations" and "created detailed reports," ensuring defensibility if an interviewer asks for evidence.

**ATS / SOC Keywords:**
- **Relevance to Job Description**: The keywords are chosen based on the technical expectations and soft skills listed in the job description. They highlight critical abilities like incident response, log monitoring, and documentation.
- **Focus on Lab Work**: The terms reflect hands-on, lab-based experience that can be easily mapped to real-world SOC scenarios.

By making these changes, the resume becomes more aligned with the desired role and provides concrete evidence of relevant skills and experiences.
