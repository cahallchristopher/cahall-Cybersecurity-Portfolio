### Explanation of Changes

1. **Alignment with SOC Workflows:**
   - The revised bullets now explicitly reference the SOC workflow steps (monitoring, triage, investigation, documentation, escalation) to better align with the target job description.

2. **Focus on Lab-Based Experience:**
   - Emphasized lab-based experiences over production environments, ensuring that all claims are defensible and relevant to an academic or simulated context.

3. **Technical Details and Observations:**
   - Included specific technical details such as "monitored alerts," "analyzed network traffic," and "gathered evidence" to provide concrete examples of investigative work.

4. **Clarity and Relevance:**
   - Removed buzzwords and focused on clear, concise language that directly relates to the role's requirements.
   - Ensured each bullet can be defended with specific evidence such as lab outputs or documented procedures.

5. **Soft Skills and Technical Proficiency:**
   - Highlighted soft skills like communication and documentation alongside technical competencies, showing a well-rounded approach to cybersecurity analysis.

By making these changes, the resume now more accurately reflects the role of an entry-level SOC Analyst while maintaining relevance and defensibility in the context of academic or simulated lab work.
