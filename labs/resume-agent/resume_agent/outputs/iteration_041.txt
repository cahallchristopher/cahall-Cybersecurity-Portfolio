### Explanation of Changes

- **Detection and Triage:** The bullets now explicitly mention "detection" and "triage," which are key terms in SOC workflows. This ensures that the experience aligns with the job description's expectations.
  
- **Investigation and Analysis:** By emphasizing "investigation and analysis," we highlight the analytical skills needed for cybersecurity roles, such as identifying root causes of issues and analyzing network traffic.

- **Incident Response & Documentation:** The revised bullets now explicitly include incident response and documentation, which are critical responsibilities in SOC analyst roles. This ensures that the resume highlights relevant skills and experience.

- **Network Traffic Analysis:** By mentioning "network traffic analysis" specifically, we demonstrate proficiency with key security tools and techniques that align closely with the job description's expectations.

These changes ensure that the resume is optimized for ATS systems and clearly communicates the necessary skills and experience for an entry-level SOC or junior cybersecurity analyst role.
