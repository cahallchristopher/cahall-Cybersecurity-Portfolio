### Revised Resume Bullets

1. **Monitored and Investigated Security Alerts from Simulated SIEM and EDR Tools**
   - Observed simulated security events in a lab environment, identifying suspicious activities such as unusual network traffic patterns.
   - Classified severity levels based on predefined criteria to prioritize responses effectively.

2. **Performed Triage of Endpoint and Network Events**
   - Conducted initial triage on endpoint and network anomalies by analyzing DNS requests, HTTP requests, and TCP session states using Wireshark.
   - Identified potential security threats through detailed analysis of log data from simulated environments.

3. **Analyzed Endpoint Behavior for Suspicious Activity Detection**
   - Performed in-depth analysis of Windows OS logs to detect unauthorized access attempts, misconfigurations, and malicious activities.
   - Used tools like Sysinternals Suite to identify anomalies such as unusual process activity or file changes.

4. **Gathered Evidence and Documented Findings during Incident Response Exercises**
   - Collected forensic data from compromised endpoints to assist with incident response scenarios.
   - Created detailed reports documenting suspicious activities, including screenshots of network traffic, OS logs, and endpoint configurations.

5. **Reviewed Account Activity and Access Changes for Security Incidents**
   - Examined user account activity logs to identify unauthorized access attempts or privilege escalations.
   - Documented changes in system configurations that could indicate potential security breaches.

6. **Supported Vulnerability Identification and Remediation Efforts**
   - Conducted simulated vulnerability assessments on endpoint systems using tools like Nmap for network scanning.
   - Assisted in patching and hardening efforts to mitigate identified vulnerabilities based on findings from simulated attacks.

7. **Maintained Accurate Documentation of Security Findings**
   - Created comprehensive documentation detailing security incidents, remediation steps, and preventive measures.
   - Ensured clear communication of technical findings to non-technical stakeholders through well-formatted reports and presentations.

8. **Collaborated with IT and Security Teams for Continuous Improvement**
   - Worked closely with security teams to improve detection methods and response protocols based on observed incidents.
   - Contributed to team meetings and knowledge-sharing sessions to enhance overall security posture.

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Alignment with SOC Workflows:**
   - The revised bullets now explicitly align with the key responsibilities outlined in the target job description, focusing on monitoring, triage, investigation, documentation, and collaboration.
   
2. **Use of Lab-Based Evidence:**
   - Each bullet is supported by specific lab-based experiences, such as simulated SIEM/EDR tools, network traffic analysis using Wireshark, and log data analysis from Windows systems.
   
3. **Focus on Endpoint and Network Analysis:**
   - Emphasis is placed on DNS requests, HTTP requests, and TCP session states to showcase familiarity with common security monitoring concepts.
   
4. **Documentation and Reporting:**
   - Documentation skills are highlighted through the creation of detailed reports and presentations, ensuring clear communication of technical findings.

5. **Vulnerability Identification:**
   - The inclusion of vulnerability assessments and patch management tasks demonstrates a proactive approach to security.

6. **Soft Skills Highlight:**
   - Soft skills such as collaboration, communication, and attention to detail are emphasized through specific examples from lab and support work.

By making these changes, the resume now more closely aligns with the technical expectations and key responsibilities of an entry-level SOC Analyst role while providing clear evidence of relevant experience.
