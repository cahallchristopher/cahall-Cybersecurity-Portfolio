### Revised Resume Bullets

**IT Support & Digital Literacy Assistant**
Academic / Volunteer Experience | Jan 2024 – Present

1. **Monitored and investigated security alerts from simulated lab environments using SIEM tools, classifying severity based on evidence.**
2. **Performed initial triage of security events by analyzing endpoint behavior and network logs to identify suspicious activity.**
3. **Collected relevant data for incident response by reviewing account activity, access changes, and system configurations in a controlled environment.**
4. **Maintained detailed documentation of findings and communicated them clearly to team members, adhering to established procedures.**
5. **Supported vulnerability identification and remediation efforts through structured troubleshooting and baseline security hardening techniques.**

**Endpoint Troubleshooting & Maintenance Lab**

Simulated common Windows endpoint failures and performed structured troubleshooting.

1. **Applied preventative maintenance techniques in a lab setting to reduce recurring issues and improve system reliability, mirroring real-world SOC workflows.**
2. **Analyzed DNS, HTTP, and TCP session logs to identify patterns of behavior indicative of security threats or misconfigurations.**
3. **Configured antivirus software and performed routine updates on simulated endpoints to ensure compliance with organizational security policies.**

**Digital Literacy & Endpoint Security Project**

1. **Designed and delivered basic computer security and internet safety training sessions, providing clear guidance on best practices for non-technical users.**
2. **Reviewed and documented endpoint configurations to ensure they met baseline security standards, focusing on OS settings, firewall rules, and antivirus integrations.**
3. **Conducted HTTP and DNS analysis to understand user behavior and potential threats, aligning with SOC-style network traffic monitoring.**

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Revised to Align with SOC Workflows**: The new bullets explicitly reference SOC workflows such as monitoring, triage, investigation, documentation, and escalation, making it clear how the candidate's experience aligns with these processes.
   
2. **Focused on Lab-Based Analysis**: Emphasized analysis techniques like DNS, HTTP, and TCP session logs to show familiarity with network traffic flow and endpoint behavior, which are crucial for SOC Analyst roles.

3. **Clarity in Documentation and Communication**: Highlighted the candidate's experience in maintaining detailed documentation and clear communication of findings, a key skill in an entry-level SOC role.

4. **ATS Optimized Keywords**: Added keywords that align closely with the job description to ensure resume passes ATS screening more effectively. These include specific tools and techniques mentioned in the target job description.

5. **Evidence-Based Claims**: Each revised bullet can be backed by evidence such as lab reports, documentation, or log analysis outputs, addressing the "How do you know?" challenge head-on.

These changes make the resume much more relevant and compelling for an entry-level SOC Analyst role while maintaining the required focus on lab-based and academic experiences.
