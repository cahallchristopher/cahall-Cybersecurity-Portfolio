### Revised Resume Bullets

**IT Support & Digital Literacy Assistant**
Academic / Volunteer Experience | Jan 2024 – Present

- **Detection and Triage**: Monitored simulated endpoints for anomalies, conducted initial triage to classify severity, and escalated critical issues to the appropriate team.
- **Investigation and Analysis**: Analyzed system logs and network traffic (DNS, HTTP) to identify suspicious activities, such as unauthorized access attempts or unusual login patterns.
- **Documentation and Reporting**: Created detailed documentation of findings, including evidence-gathering steps and analysis results, for further investigation by senior analysts.
- **Incident Response**: Assisted in the initial response to simulated security incidents by gathering relevant data from endpoints and network devices.
- **Security Tool Familiarity**: Utilized antivirus software and endpoint protection tools (e.g., ESET NOD32) to configure baseline security settings and perform routine maintenance.

**Endpoint Troubleshooting & Maintenance Lab**

- **Detection of Endpoint Failures**: Identified common Windows endpoint failures, such as OS crashes, misconfigurations, and application errors, through structured troubleshooting.
- **Triage and Root Cause Analysis**: Conducted in-depth analysis of system behavior to isolate root causes of issues, ensuring effective resolution and preventing future occurrences.
- **Network Traffic Analysis**: Analyzed DNS and HTTP session data to monitor traffic flow and detect potential security threats, such as malicious domain requests or unusual download patterns.

**Digital Literacy & Endpoint Security Project**

- **Training Delivery and Support**: Provided one-on-one digital literacy training on internet safety and cybersecurity best practices to non-technical users.
- **Security Configuration**: Configured antivirus software and implemented baseline OS hardening techniques to enhance endpoint security posture.
