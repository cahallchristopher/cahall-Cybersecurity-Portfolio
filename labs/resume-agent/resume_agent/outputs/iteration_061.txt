### Explanation of Changes

**Revised Resume Bullets:**
- The revised bullets now explicitly use terms and processes that align with the role description, such as "monitored and triaged security events," which directly correlates to SOC Analyst responsibilities.
- Specific examples from lab scenarios are provided to show practical application of skills in a controlled environment. This includes network traffic analysis and endpoint hardening, which reflect the technical expectations outlined.

**ATS / SOC Keywords:**
- The keywords are chosen based on the job description's emphasis on monitoring, triage, security alerts, and incident response processes.
- They also highlight relevant technical areas such as network traffic analysis and vulnerability assessment to ensure the resume stands out in an ATS (Applicant Tracking System).

These changes make it clear that you have experience and skills directly related to entry-level SOC roles, aligning your experience with the expectations of potential employers.
