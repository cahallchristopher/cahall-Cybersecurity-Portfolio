### Explanation of Changes

**Changes Made:**
- **Alignment with SOC Workflows**: The revised bullets now emphasize the use of SOC workflows such as detection, triage, and investigation. This aligns more closely with the job description’s emphasis on monitoring security alerts, performing initial triage, and analyzing network data.
- **Use of Lab-Based Examples**: By focusing on simulated environments like SIEM tools, PCAP analysis, and endpoint troubleshooting labs, the examples are defensible and show practical experience in a controlled setting. This is crucial for entry-level positions where real-world production experience may not be available.
- **Technical Detail**: The revised bullets include specific technical details (e.g., DNS requests, HTTP sessions) that provide evidence of hands-on experience with network traffic analysis, which is highly valued in SOC roles.
- **Clarity and Defensibility**: Each bullet now clearly states what was done and the outcomes achieved, making it easier for an interviewer to validate these claims. This approach ensures that every statement can be substantiated if asked about during interviews.

These changes ensure that your resume aligns closely with the role description while highlighting relevant skills and experiences in a defensible manner.
