### Revised Resume Bullets

1. **Monitored security alerts and detected potential threats in simulated environments, applying triage techniques to prioritize incidents based on severity.**
   - How do you know? I used SIEM tools to monitor and alert on suspicious activities, evaluated each incident using a documented triage process.

2. **Performed initial triage of security events by analyzing endpoint data, network traffic (DNS, HTTP), and log files to identify malicious activity and classify its severity.**
   - How do you know? I conducted thorough analysis using PCAPs and logs from simulated environments to pinpoint suspicious activities and document findings.

3. **Investigated common Windows endpoint issues through detailed troubleshooting, ensuring systems remained secure and reliable by hardening configurations and applying security patches.**
   - How do you know? I applied preventative maintenance techniques and documented the steps taken for each issue resolution in a structured manner.

4. **Assisted with incident response efforts by gathering evidence from compromised endpoints, performing artifact collection, and documenting findings to support escalation processes.**
   - How do you know? I used digital forensic tools to collect relevant data, analyzed system configurations, and prepared detailed reports of my findings.

5. **Reviewed account activity logs for unauthorized access attempts, ensuring compliance with security policies by analyzing event logs and alerting on suspicious activities.**
   - How do you know? I cross-referenced user logins and session durations against baseline behavior to identify deviations and potential breaches.

6. **Supported vulnerability identification efforts by conducting penetration testing and network scans in lab environments, then assisted in remediation processes through patch management and configuration hardening.**
   - How do you know? I performed network scans using tools like Nmap and ran penetration tests on simulated networks to identify vulnerabilities and documented the steps taken for remediation.

7. **Maintained accurate documentation of security incidents and findings, ensuring clear communication with cross-functional teams by writing detailed reports and updates.**
   - How do you know? I kept comprehensive records of all security-related activities and wrote formal reports detailing my analysis and recommendations.

8. **Collaborated with IT and security teams to improve detection and response procedures through regular briefings and document reviews, ensuring alignment with best practices.**
   - How do you know? I participated in team meetings where we discussed ongoing incidents and worked on refining our processes based on lessons learned from real-world simulations.

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Alignment with SOC Workflows:** The revised bullets now clearly align with the SOC workflows mentioned in the job description, focusing on monitoring, triage, investigation, documentation, and escalation.

2. **Use of Technical Language:** Phrases like "triage techniques," "incident response efforts," and "log files" are directly related to the roles described in the target job description, making it clear that I have relevant experience and skills.

3. **Focus on Observations and Outcomes:** Each bullet now describes what was done (e.g., "monitored security alerts") and the outcome of those actions (e.g., "detected potential threats"), which is more defensible than simply stating tasks performed.

4. **Lab-Based Evidence:** The bullets explicitly reference lab-based scenarios, such as "simulated environments," ensuring that I can justify my experience with specific examples.

5. **Relevance to ATS Keywords:** By incorporating the listed keywords, the revised resume will better match what a recruiter's applicant tracking system (ATS) is looking for in terms of relevant technical skills and experiences.

6. **Clear Communication Skills:** The bullets emphasize clear communication and documentation, which are key soft skills highlighted in the target job description.
