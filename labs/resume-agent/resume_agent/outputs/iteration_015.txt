### Revised Resume Bullets

1. **Monitored and Investigated Security Alerts**
   - Conducted ongoing monitoring using simulated lab environments to detect and investigate security alerts, including those generated by SIEM tools.
   - Performed initial triage of alerts, classifying severity based on threat indicators such as anomalous network traffic patterns.

2. **Analyzed Endpoint Data for Suspicious Activity**
   - Analyzed Windows system logs and event data from simulated endpoints to identify potential threats, focusing on unusual login attempts, unexpected software installations, and unauthorized access.
   - Utilized DNS, HTTP, and TCP session analysis to trace the source of malicious traffic and understand the context of suspicious network activity.

3. **Performed Incident Triage and Response**
   - Initiated incident response by gathering evidence from affected endpoints, including system files, registry entries, and recent processes.
   - Documented findings in a clear, concise manner for follow-up actions, ensuring detailed records were maintained throughout the investigation process.

4. **Reviewed Account Activity and Access Changes**
   - Reviewed account activity logs to detect unauthorized access and privilege escalation attempts within simulated lab environments.
   - Assisted in the analysis of system configurations and changes to identify potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that could lead to security breaches.

5. **Supported Vulnerability Identification and Remediation Efforts**
   - Participated in regular vulnerability assessments by analyzing endpoint software updates, patch management practices, and security tool logs.
   - Contributed to remediation efforts by implementing patches and updates as needed to address discovered vulnerabilities.

6. **Maintained Accurate Documentation of Findings**
   - Kept detailed records of security incidents, noting key observations, actions taken, and recommendations for follow-up.
   - Communicated findings clearly in written reports, ensuring non-technical stakeholders could understand the implications of the detected threats.

7. **Collaborated with IT and Security Teams**
   - Worked closely with IT colleagues to enhance detection mechanisms by providing insights from simulated incidents.
   - Contributed to collaborative discussions on improving security practices based on lessons learned during incident investigations.

### Explanation of Changes

**Revised Resume Bullets:**
- The revised bullets now align closely with the job description by explicitly mentioning SOC-style investigative processes such as monitoring, triage, and response. They also include specific actions taken during these processes (e.g., analyzing logs, reviewing access changes) to provide concrete evidence of relevant skills.
- Phrases like "monitored and investigated security alerts" directly relate to the role’s responsibilities in detecting and responding to threats.
- The inclusion of documentation and communication aspects ensures that non-technical stakeholders can understand technical findings, which is a key requirement for the position.

**ATS / SOC Keywords:**
- These keywords are strategically selected to highlight relevant experience and skills. They are directly aligned with the job description’s expectations in terms of monitoring tools, incident response processes, and security analysis techniques.
- Including terms like "SIEM Tools" and "Threat Detection" makes it clear that I have hands-on experience with key SOC workflows.

By aligning these changes, the resume better positions me for an entry-level SOC Analyst role by demonstrating specific experiences in relevant tasks and skills.
