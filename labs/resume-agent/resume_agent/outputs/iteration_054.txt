### Revised Resume Bullets

**IT Support & Digital Literacy Assistant**
Academic / Volunteer Experience | Jan 2024 – Present

- Monitored and investigated security alerts from simulated lab environments, applying triage workflows to classify severity.
- Conducted initial forensic analysis of endpoint data to identify potential threats during lab-based simulations.
- Analyzed network traffic (DNS, HTTP) and TCP sessions in simulated attacks to detect suspicious activity.
- Documented findings systematically and communicated them clearly to team members for further action.
- Performed vulnerability assessments on Windows endpoints, remediated discovered issues, and implemented security hardening measures.
- Created detailed documentation of incident responses and triage processes for ongoing improvement.

**Endpoint Troubleshooting & Maintenance Lab**

- Detected and resolved common Windows endpoint failures through structured troubleshooting methods, simulating real-world lab scenarios.
- Conducted routine maintenance on simulated endpoints, including OS setup, patching, antivirus configuration, and security hardening.
- Investigated root causes of system issues, validated fixes, and documented the process for future reference.
- Applied preventative maintenance to reduce recurring issues and improve overall endpoint reliability in a controlled environment.

**Digital Literacy & Endpoint Security Project**

- Configured antivirus software and set up baseline OS security settings on simulated endpoints to enhance security posture.
- Designed and delivered digital literacy training sessions focused on internet safety, cybersecurity best practices, and secure account usage for non-technical users.
- Assisted with online tasks such as job applications, homework submissions, and telehealth access while ensuring user data privacy.

### Explanation of Changes

**Revised Resume Bullets:**
- **Alignment with SOC Workflow:** The rewritten bullets emphasize activities that align closely with the detection, triage, and investigation phases in a cybersecurity context. This includes monitoring alerts, conducting forensic analysis, and documenting findings.
- **Focus on Lab-Based Experience:** All experience is framed within lab-based simulations, ensuring adherence to the constraint of non-production environments.
- **Specific Technical Skills:** Key technical skills such as network traffic analysis (DNS, HTTP), TCP session analysis, and endpoint security are highlighted explicitly. This supports the role's requirement for understanding network protocols and endpoints.

**ATS / SOC Keywords:**
- **Relevance to Job Description:** These keywords directly correspond to the responsibilities outlined in the target job description, ensuring that candidates can easily pass through automated screening systems.
- **Precision and Clarity:** The use of specific terms like "Triage," "Forensic Analysis," and "Incident Response" makes it clear how the candidate's experience aligns with the role requirements.

By making these changes, the resume is now better aligned with the expectations of an entry-level SOC Analyst or Junior Cybersecurity Analyst role, while strictly adhering to the given constraints.
