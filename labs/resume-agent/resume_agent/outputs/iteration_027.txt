### Explanation of Changes

**1. Focus on SOC Workflows:**
   - The revised bullets now explicitly align with the provided job description by focusing on monitoring, triage, investigation, and documentation—key components in a SOC analyst role.

**2. Emphasis on Lab-Based Experience:**
   - By framing work in a simulated environment, we emphasize that this experience is relevant but not in production settings, adhering to the strict constraints.

**3. Use of Clear, Concise Language:**
   - The language has been refined to be more precise and aligned with the target job description, ensuring each bullet directly supports the role's responsibilities.

**4. ATS / SOC Relevance:**
   - Including specific keywords such as "Security Alerts," "Endpoint Monitoring," and "Triage Workflow" helps align the resume content closely with what an ATS or interviewer would be looking for in a junior cybersecurity analyst position.

By making these changes, Christopher Cahall's resume now more accurately reflects his lab-based experience and ensures it is relevant to the role he is targeting.
