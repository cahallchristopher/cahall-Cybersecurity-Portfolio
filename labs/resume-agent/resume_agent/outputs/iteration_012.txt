### Explanation of Changes

- **Alignment with Job Description:** The revised resume bullets were crafted to closely match the responsibilities and technical expectations outlined in the target job description. This includes focusing on detection, triage, investigation, documentation, and escalation processes—key aspects of an entry-level SOC Analyst role.
  
- **Laboratory-Based Experience Emphasis:** By highlighting lab-based scenarios and simulations, we ensure that all experience is rooted in practical, defensible examples rather than theoretical or hypothetical situations. This approach meets the requirement to avoid assumptions about production environments.

- **Use of Specific Techniques and Tools:** The use of terms like "PCAPs," "log files," "SIEM tools," and "vulnerability assessment" align with technical expectations and provide concrete evidence of relevant skills and experience.
  
- **Focus on Observations and Outcomes:** Rather than merely listing tasks, the revised bullets describe specific actions taken and their outcomes, ensuring that each example can be validated if an interviewer asks for evidence or explanation.

- **Soft Skills Highlighted:** The inclusion of soft skills such as communication, documentation, and attention to detail emphasizes the ability to explain technical issues clearly, a critical skill for non-technical users in SOC roles.
