### Explanation of Changes

#### Revised Resume Bullets:
- **Alignment with SOC Workflows:** Each bullet now reflects a step in the SOC workflow, ensuring that experiences are presented as part of a structured incident response process.
- **Use of Lab-Based Evidence:** The revised bullets draw on specific lab scenarios (e.g., network traffic analysis, log collection) to support claims and provide verifiable evidence.
- **Clarity and Conciseness:** Language has been refined for clarity and relevance, ensuring that each bullet is focused and directly supports the role description.

#### ATS / SOC Keywords:
- **Relevance to Job Description:** These keywords are chosen based on the job responsibilities outlined in the target description, ensuring that they align with what an interviewer would expect.
- **Specificity of Skills:** The keywords focus on specific skills (e.g., endpoint security, network traffic analysis) rather than generic terms, making it clear how these skills were applied in practical scenarios.

By making these changes, the resume more effectively demonstrates the candidate's experience and preparedness for the role of an entry-level SOC or junior cybersecurity analyst.
