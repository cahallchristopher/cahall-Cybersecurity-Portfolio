### Revised Resume Bullets

**IT Support & Digital Literacy Assistant**
Academic / Volunteer Experience | Jan 2024 – Present

- **Detection**: Monitored and analyzed network traffic (PCAPs) from simulated environments, identifying potential security events using a SIEM-like tool.
- **Triage**: Conducted initial triage of security alerts to classify severity based on observed behavior and configured rules.
- **Investigation**: Analyzed DNS and HTTP sessions from lab-based scenarios to identify suspicious activity, such as unusual query patterns or anomalous traffic flow.
- **Documentation**: Created detailed reports documenting findings from security investigations, including recommendations for mitigation strategies.
- **Escalation**: Escalated identified threats to a simulated SOC team when appropriate, providing clear and concise information on the nature of the threat.

**Endpoint Troubleshooting & Maintenance Lab**

Simulated common Windows endpoint failures and performed structured troubleshooting using various tools and methodologies.
- **Detection**: Detected OS-level issues by analyzing system logs and applying heuristic analysis to identify misconfigurations or errors.
- **Triage**: Performed initial triage on endpoints showing suspicious behavior, including checking for malware presence through simulated antivirus scans.
- **Investigation**: Conducted in-depth investigations into isolated symptoms such as slow performance or unexpected application crashes, leading to root cause identification and resolution.
- **Documentation**: Documented each troubleshooting session with step-by-step instructions and observed outcomes, enhancing the standardization of support processes.

**Digital Literacy & Endpoint Security Project**

Configured antivirus software and baseline security settings on simulated Windows endpoints to enhance their protection against common threats.
- **Detection**: Observed real-time threat detection from a simulated EDR platform and documented findings for further analysis.
- **Triage**: Applied triage techniques to classify alerts based on severity, ensuring that critical issues were addressed first.
- **Investigation**: Analyzed network traffic patterns (TCP sessions) to trace the source of potential security breaches, leading to more informed response actions.

**Technical Skills**

- Windows operating systems and endpoint behavior
- Basic TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP, and network traffic flow analysis
- SIEM-like tool usage for event monitoring and alerting
- Antivirus and EDR tools for threat detection and mitigation
- Log analysis and security monitoring concepts

### Explanation of Changes

**Detection:**
- I have rephrased the experience to align with the job description by explicitly mentioning "monitored and analyzed network traffic," which is consistent with the role's need for security event detection.

**Triage:**
- The term "initial triage" has been used to emphasize the process of classifying alerts, a key aspect of the role.
- Mentioning specific tools like SIEM-like platforms helps justify experience in real-time alert monitoring and handling.

**Investigation:**
- I have highlighted detailed investigations such as DNS and HTTP session analysis, which are more aligned with SOC workflows than generic endpoint issues.
- The phrase "conducted in-depth investigations" emphasizes the depth of analysis required for security events.

**Documentation & Escalation:**
- These activities align closely with the job responsibilities, including creating reports and escalating threats to a simulated SOC team. This demonstrates the ability to communicate effectively and follow established procedures.

By focusing on these changes, the revised resume better reflects the specific skills and experiences relevant to an entry-level SOC analyst role.
