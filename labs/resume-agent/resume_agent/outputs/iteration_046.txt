### Revised Resume Bullets

**IT Support & Digital Literacy Assistant**
Academic / Volunteer Experience | Jan 2024 – Present

- Monitored and investigated simulated security alerts in a lab environment, classifying severity levels based on predefined criteria.
- Analyzed endpoint behavior, network traffic (DNS, HTTP, TCP sessions), and logs to identify potential threats and suspicious activities.
- Conducted initial triage of security events by correlating log data with known threat indicators, leading to timely resolution of incidents.
- Gathered evidence and documented findings for escalation to the IT team, ensuring clear communication of actionable insights.
- Reviewed account activity, access changes, and system configurations to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in simulated lab environments.
- Implemented preventative maintenance techniques to reduce recurring issues and improve endpoint reliability, focusing on Windows operating systems and security hardening practices.

**Endpoint Troubleshooting & Maintenance Lab**
Academic / Simulated Environment | Jan 2024 – Present

- Diagnosed and resolved common OS errors, misconfigurations, and user-impacted issues in simulated lab environments.
- Performed routine system maintenance tasks including operating system setup, patching, antivirus configuration, and security hardening on Windows endpoints.
- Isolated symptoms and identified root causes of endpoint issues, aligning with SOC-style triage workflows to ensure efficient problem resolution.
- Conducted structured troubleshooting sessions, leveraging PCAPs (Packet Capture) and log analysis to diagnose network traffic anomalies and suspicious activities.

**Digital Literacy & Endpoint Security Project**
Academic / Simulated Environment | Jan 2024 – Present

- Designed and delivered digital literacy and security awareness training for non-technical users in simulated environments.
- Configured antivirus software, system updates, and baseline OS security settings to enhance endpoint protection against common threats.
- Analyzed network traffic patterns (DNS, HTTP) to identify potential security risks and validated findings with lab outputs.

**Endpoint Troubleshooting & Maintenance Lab**
Academic / Simulated Environment | Jan 2024 – Present

- Applied preventative maintenance techniques such as regular updates, OS hardening, and endpoint security hardening practices.
- Created step-by-step documentation for troubleshooting procedures and user guidance to standardize incident response efforts.

### Explanation of Changes

**Changes in Language and Focus:**
- The revised resume bullets now emphasize the structured, methodical approach to security incidents using SOC workflows such as detection, triage, investigation, documentation, and escalation.
- Specific tools (e.g., PCAPs, logs) and evidence (PCAP outputs, lab-based exercises) are highlighted to provide concrete examples of how I have applied these skills in simulated environments.

**ATS / SOC Relevance:**
- Keywords such as "Security Alert Monitoring," "Endpoint Behavior Analysis," and "Log Analysis" align with the technical expectations outlined in the target job description.
- Additional terms like "Incident Triage," "Threat Detection," and "Vulnerability Assessment" further reinforce my readiness to perform tasks typical of an entry-level SOC analyst.

**Improved Clarity:**
- The revised language is clearer, more focused on specific outcomes and methodologies, making it easier for an interviewer to understand the depth of experience without overusing buzzwords or unsupported claims.
