### Revised Resume Bullets

**IT Support & Digital Literacy Assistant**
Academic / Volunteer Experience | Jan 2024 – Present

- **Monitored and Resolved Security Alerts:** Detected and addressed simulated security alerts in a lab environment, classifying severity and escalating as necessary to follow documented procedures.
  
- **Performed Endpoint Triage:** Conducted initial triage of security events by analyzing endpoint behavior and network traffic patterns, identifying suspicious activities through DNS and HTTP requests.

- **Analyzed Network Traffic:** Investigated network packets using PCAP files and Wireshark to identify anomalies in TCP sessions related to potential threats or unauthorized access attempts.
  
- **Identified Suspicious Activity:** Analyzed log data (e.g., event logs, firewall logs) to uncover signs of compromise, focusing on user behavior patterns and system changes.

- **Gathered Evidence for Incident Response:** Collected evidence from endpoints, network devices, and other relevant sources during simulated incident response exercises, documenting findings in a clear and concise manner.
  
- **Supported Vulnerability Identification:** Assisted with the identification and remediation of vulnerabilities by reviewing security configurations, applying patches, and configuring antivirus software on endpoints.

- **Documented Findings Accurately:** Created detailed reports summarizing investigation outcomes, providing actionable insights for follow-up actions to enhance system resilience.

**Endpoint Troubleshooting & Maintenance Lab**

Simulated common Windows endpoint failures and performed structured troubleshooting, documenting processes and outcomes in a clear and organized manner.

**Digital Literacy & Endpoint Security Project**

- **Configured Antivirus Software:** Set up and configured antivirus solutions on simulated endpoints, ensuring baseline security measures were implemented effectively.
  
- **Applied Preventative Maintenance:** Performed routine maintenance tasks to reduce recurring issues and improve system reliability, focusing on OS updates, patch management, and basic hardening techniques.

### Explanation of Changes

**Revised Resume Bullets:**
- **Alignment with SOC Workflows:** The revised bullets now explicitly align with the provided job description by emphasizing SOC workflows such as monitoring, triage, and investigation.
  
- **Use of Lab-Based Evidence:** Each bullet is grounded in specific lab-based or simulated experience, providing concrete evidence to support claims made about security skills.
  
- **Focus on Observations and Outcomes:** The language now focuses more on the outcomes and observations derived from analysis (e.g., DNS and HTTP requests), rather than just tools used.

**ATS / SOC Keywords:**
- **Relevant Terminology:** The keywords are chosen to reflect common terms in SOC environments, ensuring that a resume scanning tool or interviewer would recognize relevant skills.
  
- **Specific Tools & Techniques:** Keywords include specific tools (Wireshark) and techniques (PCAP Files), showing familiarity with practical methods used in security analysis.

These changes ensure the resume is more aligned with the entry-level SOC role description while maintaining focus on lab-based, academic, or simulated experience.
