This change ensures that each task can be directly related to the responsibilities described in the target job description.
  
- **Inclusion of Lab Work:** By framing lab-based work as part of a simulated environment, the revised experience clearly demonstrates the ability to handle security alerts, perform network traffic analysis, and document findings—key elements for an entry-level SOC role.

- **Use of Specific Terminology:** The inclusion of terms like "Endpoint Triage," "Network Traffic Analysis," and "Incident Response" directly align with the job description's expectations. These terms indicate a deeper understanding of security monitoring and response processes.
  
- **ATS Keywords:** The list of ATS keywords provides relevant search terms that can be used by applicant tracking systems to match candidates to job postings. This ensures that resume content is easily searchable and highlights key skills required for an SOC Analyst role.

By making these changes, the revised resume more accurately reflects the experience needed for an entry-level SOC Analyst position while ensuring clarity and professionalism in the presentation of technical skills and experience.
