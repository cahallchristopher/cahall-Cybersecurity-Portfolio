### Explanation of Changes

- **Alignment with SOC Workflows**: The revised bullets now clearly reflect the entry-level SOC Analyst role, focusing on tasks like monitoring and triaging security alerts, conducting investigations, gathering evidence, and creating detailed documentation.
- **Use of Lab-Based Evidence**: Each bullet includes specific examples from lab environments (e.g., DNS queries, HTTP requests), ensuring that the experience can be substantiated with real-world data if an interviewer questions the claims.
- **Focus on Investigative Skills**: The language now emphasizes analysis and investigation over simple support tasks, aligning more closely with the responsibilities of a SOC Analyst role.
- **Technical Details and Tools**: By specifying tools like DNS queries and HTTP requests, we provide concrete evidence of technical knowledge without relying solely on tool names. This approach ensures that the resume is both detailed and defensible.
- **Clarity and Precision**: The revised bullets are more concise and precise, making it easier for recruiters to quickly identify relevant skills and experiences.
