### Explanation of Changes

1. **Alignment with Job Description:** The revised bullets now explicitly align with the key responsibilities outlined in the job description, focusing on SOC-style workflows such as detection, triage, investigation, documentation, and escalation.
2. **Laboratory-Based Experience:** All experience is framed within a lab-based context to ensure it meets the requirement of being academic or simulated work.
3. **Clear Use Cases:** Each bullet now includes specific examples of tasks performed in a laboratory setting that directly relate to SOC Analyst responsibilities, ensuring defensibility if asked by an interviewer.
4. **Use of Relevant Terminology:** The use of keywords such as "detection," "triage," "investigation," and "escalation" is evident in the revised bullets, making it clear how they align with the technical expectations for the role.

These changes ensure that your resume directly addresses the requirements of an entry-level SOC Analyst position while maintaining a focus on evidence-based claims from academic or simulated work experiences.
