### Explanation of Changes

**Alignment with Job Description:**
The revised resume bullets are structured to closely match the key responsibilities outlined in the target job description for an Entry-Level SOC Analyst or Junior Cybersecurity Analyst role. Each bullet now explicitly demonstrates experience in monitoring, triaging, and investigating security alerts, aligning directly with the expected technical skills.

- **Monitoring**: The term is used throughout to emphasize continuous watchfulness over simulated environments.
- **Triage and Classification**: These terms are specifically mentioned to highlight how events were categorized based on severity.
- **Network Traffic Analysis**: By focusing on TCP/IP, DNS, and HTTP analysis, we align with the technical expectations for network traffic investigation.
- **Documentation and Reporting**: Documentation of findings is a critical aspect of SOC roles, as demonstrated through detailed reports created in various projects.

**ATS / SOC Keywords:**
The keyword list includes terms that are highly relevant to SOC analysts, ensuring that job applicant tracking systems (ATS) can easily identify suitable candidates based on their experience. These keywords cover the core skills required for monitoring, analysis, and reporting activities within a simulated or lab-based environment.

By focusing on these specific changes, the resume becomes more aligned with the desired role while providing clear evidence of relevant experience and capabilities.
