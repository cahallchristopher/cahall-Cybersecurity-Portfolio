### Explanation of Changes

The revised resume bullets have been tailored to align more closely with the job description for an entry-level SOC Analyst role by:

- **Emphasizing SOC Workflows**: Each bullet now reflects specific steps within a typical SOC workflow, such as monitoring and investigating security alerts, performing triage, analyzing network traffic, and documenting findings.
- **Using Relevant Language**: Terms like "monitored," "investigated," and "triaged" have been used to mirror the language from the job description. This makes it clear that the candidate has experience in these areas.
- **Focusing on Technical Analysis**: The revised bullets focus more on technical analysis of network traffic, logs, and endpoints, aligning with the expectation for basic knowledge of TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP, and network traffic flow.
- **Highlighting Documentation and Reporting**: There is an emphasis on creating detailed documentation to support incident response efforts, which is a key skill in SOC roles.
- **Incorporating Lab Experience**: The lab-based experience is described in terms that can be applied to real-world scenarios, such as performing structured troubleshooting and using network traffic analysis tools.

These changes ensure the resume is more relevant to the job description and will resonate better with potential interviewers.
