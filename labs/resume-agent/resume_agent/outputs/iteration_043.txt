### Explanation of Changes

**Revised Resume Bullets:**

- **Alignment with Job Description:** The revised bullets focus on the specific tasks mentioned in the job description, such as monitoring security alerts, performing initial triage, analyzing endpoint data, assisting with incident response, and maintaining documentation.
  
- **Use of SOC Workflows:** Each bullet now follows a clear SOC workflow (detection, triage, investigation) to better align with the desired role. For example, "Performing structured monitoring and triage" directly addresses initial alert handling in an SOAR environment.

- **Specific Tools and Techniques:** By mentioning specific techniques like DNS and HTTP session analysis, TCP session analysis, and configuration of antivirus software, we provide evidence that the candidate has hands-on experience with relevant tools and methodologies. This supports the technical expectations outlined in the job description.

**ATS / SOC Keywords:**

- These keywords are selected based on their direct relevance to the job responsibilities described in the target role's job description. They include both common SOC terms (like SIEM, EDR/XDR) and specific technical skills (like DNS, HTTP session analysis). Including these terms ensures that candidate resumes will be more likely to pass through automated screening systems used by potential employers.

- **Improved Clarity:** The revised language is clearer and more aligned with the responsibilities of an entry-level SOC Analyst or Junior Cybersecurity Analyst. It emphasizes investigative and analytical skills rather than just support tasks, which better matches the job's expectations.

By making these changes, the resume becomes more compelling and directly relevant to the target position, increasing the chances of a successful application.
