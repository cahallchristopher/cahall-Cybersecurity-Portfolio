### Explanation of Changes

**Alignment with Job Description:**
- **Revised bullets focus on security alert monitoring, triage, and incident response**: These align directly with the key responsibilities listed in the target job description.
- **Use of lab-based experiences**: Emphasize structured analysis and triage workflows, similar to what would be expected in a SOC environment but framed as educational or simulated exercises.
- **Network traffic and log analysis skills highlighted**: Highlighting tools like Wireshark for network traffic analysis and SIEM for alert monitoring helps demonstrate the necessary technical proficiency.
- **Documented findings and clear communication**: Emphasizing documentation and reporting ensures that soft skills related to clear communication are included.

**ATS / SOC Keywords:**
- The selected keywords directly correlate with the job responsibilities, making it easier for ATS systems and interviewers to identify relevant experience. Each term reflects specific areas of expertise or tasks aligned with the role requirements, ensuring a strong match between the resume and the target position.

By following these changes, Christopher Cahall's resume is better tailored to an entry-level SOC Analyst position while maintaining authenticity in his simulated lab-based experiences.
