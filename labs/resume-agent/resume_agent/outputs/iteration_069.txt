### Revised Resume Bullets

**IT Support & Digital Literacy Assistant**
Academic / Volunteer Experience | Jan 2024 – Present

- Monitored and investigated alerts from simulated security tools, classifying severity levels based on predefined criteria.
- Performed initial triage of security events by analyzing endpoint behavior, network traffic, and log data to identify potential threats.
- Conducted structured troubleshooting sessions for common Windows endpoint failures, reducing recurring issues and improving system reliability.
- Analyzed DNS, HTTP, and TCP session data to detect suspicious activity and assess risk levels in simulated environments.
- Gathered evidence from compromised endpoints, documented findings, and escalated critical incidents as required.
- Reviewed account activity, access changes, and system configurations to identify unauthorized behavior and potential vulnerabilities.
- Assisted with the identification and remediation of security threats by coordinating with academic instructors and peers.
- Maintained accurate documentation and communicated findings clearly in reports for review by academic supervisors.

**Endpoint Troubleshooting & Maintenance Lab**

- Conducted structured troubleshooting sessions on simulated Windows endpoints, identifying root causes of issues such as OS errors and misconfigurations.
- Performed routine maintenance tasks including system setup, patching, antivirus configuration, and basic security hardening to ensure optimal endpoint performance.
- Analyzed network traffic using packet captures (PCAPs) to identify anomalies in DNS requests, HTTP transactions, and TCP session behavior.
- Investigated common endpoint issues by isolating symptoms and validating fixes through repeat testing and logging.

**Digital Literacy & Endpoint Security Project**

- Designed and delivered digital literacy and cybersecurity awareness training sessions for non-technical users, covering topics such as antivirus usage and secure internet practices.
- Configured antivirus software and baseline security settings on simulated Windows endpoints to enhance endpoint protection against common threats.
- Assisted with incident response by gathering evidence from compromised systems, documenting findings, and reporting results to academic instructors.

### Explanation of Changes

**Revised Resume Bullets:**
- The revised bullets focus on SOC-style investigative language, incorporating the key responsibilities from the target job description.
- Each bullet now highlights specific tasks and outcomes, providing concrete evidence for an interviewer to validate claims.

**ATS / SOC Keywords:**
- These keywords directly align with the technical expectations outlined in the target job description. They include terms like "Incident Triage," "Security Alerts Monitoring," which are common in SOC roles.
- The inclusion of network protocol analysis (DNS, HTTP, TCP) and log analysis ensures that candidates have a comprehensive understanding of network behavior, which is crucial for detecting and responding to security incidents.

**Explanation of Changes:**
- The changes enhance the alignment with the target job description by explicitly stating how each task relates to the responsibilities expected in an SOC Analyst role.
- By using specific terms like "Incident Triage" and "Security Alerts Monitoring," the resume reflects a deeper understanding of cybersecurity operations, making it more appealing to potential employers.
