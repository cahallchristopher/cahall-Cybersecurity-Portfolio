### Explanation of Changes

**Revised Resume Bullets:**
- The revised bullets focus on lab-based and simulated environments, aligning with the job description's requirement for experience in a controlled setting.
- Each bullet now emphasizes SOC-style investigative tasks such as monitoring alerts, analyzing network traffic, triaging incidents, and documenting findings.
- The language is adjusted to be more specific about using tools like DNS, HTTP, and TCP session analysis, reflecting the targeted technical skills needed.

**ATS / SOC Keywords:**
- These keywords are directly relevant to the job description’s focus on security monitoring, incident response, and network traffic analysis. They highlight key responsibilities such as alert monitoring, triage workflows, and log data analysis.
- By including specific terms like "SIEM Tool Usage" and "Vulnerability Assessment," we ensure that the resume resonates with ATS systems and aligns with the technical expectations of a junior SOC analyst role.

These revisions make your resume more relevant to an entry-level SOC or cybersecurity analyst position, emphasizing both practical lab experience and foundational skills.
