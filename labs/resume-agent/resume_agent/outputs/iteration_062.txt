### Explanation of Changes

1. **Aligning with SOC Workflows**: The revised bullets now clearly align with the SOC Analyst role by focusing on monitoring, triaging, investigating, documenting, and escalating security incidents. This ensures that the candidate's experience is relevant to an entry-level SOC position.

2. **Emphasizing Security Incident Analysis**: By incorporating specific analysis of network traffic (DNS, HTTP, TCP sessions) and log data, the revised bullets demonstrate the candidate's ability to conduct thorough investigations, which are crucial skills in a SOC Analyst role.

3. **Clear Documentation and Reporting**: The emphasis on documenting findings and creating clear reports helps to show the candidate’s ability to communicate technical issues effectively, a key requirement for both IT support and SOC roles.

4. **Highlighting Practical Experience**: Using terms like "SIEM alert monitoring," "incident response," and "vulnerability remediation" ensures that the resume uses language aligned with industry standards and expectations for an entry-level SOC Analyst.

5. **ATS Optimized Keywords**: The inclusion of specific keywords such as SIEM, network traffic analysis, log analysis, and incident response helps to optimize the resume for ATS systems, making it more likely to be surfaced by recruitment tools used by companies.

These changes ensure that the candidate's experience is not only relevant but also presented in a way that aligns with the target job description and is easily searchable through automated applicant tracking systems.
