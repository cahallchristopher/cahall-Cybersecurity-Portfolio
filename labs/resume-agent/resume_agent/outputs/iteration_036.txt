### Explanation of Changes

**Revised Resume Bullets:**
- The revised bullets now align with the key responsibilities outlined in the target job description by emphasizing security monitoring, incident triage, log analysis, and evidence gathering.
- Specific scenarios like analyzing simulated PCAPs, logs, and network traffic are included to provide concrete examples of lab-based investigative work.
- The addition of "Incident Triage" and "Suspicious Activity Detection" directly addresses the job's focus on initial alert response.
- Emphasis on "Gathered Evidence for Incidents," "Reviewed Account Activity," and "Documented Findings" ensures a clear connection to the role's documentation responsibilities.

**ATS / SOC Keywords:**
- The keyword list is tailored to include terms relevant to both the job description and typical ATS systems, ensuring that keywords like "Incident Triage" and "Suspicious Activity Detection" are prominently featured.
- By including specific technical skills such as "Network Traffic Analysis," "TCP Session Analysis," and "DNS Analysis," we ensure that candidates' resumes stand out in an automated screening process.

These changes improve alignment by directly addressing the job requirements, providing concrete evidence of relevant experience through lab-based scenarios, and using keywords likely to be searched for during the hiring process.
