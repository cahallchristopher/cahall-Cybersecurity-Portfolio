### Revised Resume Bullets

**IT Support & Digital Literacy Assistant**
Academic / Volunteer Experience | Jan 2024 – Present

- **Monitored and Investigated Security Alerts:** Conducted triage on simulated security alerts in a lab environment, identifying suspicious activities using tools like Splunk for SIEM.
  
- **Performed Endpoint Triage and Analysis:** Analyzed endpoint behavior through lab simulations to detect anomalies, such as unauthorized access attempts or unusual network traffic patterns.

- **Investigated Network Traffic Using PCAPs:** Used Wireshark to analyze HTTP, DNS, and TCP sessions from simulated network captures, identifying potential security incidents.
  
- **Classified Severity of Security Events:** Classified the severity of detected events based on predefined criteria, ensuring appropriate escalation to the SOC team.

- **Collected Evidence for Incident Response:** Gathered forensic data from endpoints during simulated attacks, documenting findings in a clear and concise manner.

- **Supported Vulnerability Management Efforts:** Conducted periodic vulnerability assessments on lab environments, identifying and addressing potential security risks before they became issues.

- **Documented Findings Accurately and Clearly:** Created detailed reports summarizing incident responses, including technical details and recommendations for improvement.

**Endpoint Troubleshooting & Maintenance Lab**

Simulated common Windows endpoint failures and performed structured troubleshooting to enhance system reliability and security posture.

**Digital Literacy & Endpoint Security Project**

Designed and delivered basic computer security training in a simulated environment, focusing on internet safety and best practices.

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Aligning with SOC Workflows:** The revised bullets now explicitly use SOC workflows such as "triage" and "incident response," making it clear how the experience aligns with the role's responsibilities.

2. **Emphasizing Lab-Based Experience:** By specifying lab-based simulations, we ensure that the work is clearly defensible and avoids any implication of production experience.

3. **Adding Specific Tools and Techniques:** Using terms like "Splunk" for SIEM, "Wireshark," and specific network protocols (HTTP, DNS, TCP) highlights the technical depth of the experience.

4. **Focus on Observations and Outcomes:** The revised bullets focus more on what was observed and concluded from the analysis rather than just the tools used.

5. **Clear Communication and Documentation:** Emphasizing the documentation aspect ensures that communication skills are highlighted in a way that aligns with the job description's requirement for clear reporting.

6. **Vulnerability Management:** Highlighting vulnerability assessment efforts shows preparedness to handle security threats, which is critical for an entry-level SOC role.

7. **Evidence Collection and Analysis:** The inclusion of evidence collection and analysis highlights the ability to gather relevant data for incident response, a key component in the new job description.

By making these changes, the resume now more accurately reflects the skills and experience needed for an entry-level SOC Analyst position while maintaining defensibility and relevance to the role.
