### Explanation of Changes

**Revised Resume Bullets:**
- **Align with SOC Workflows:** The revised bullets emphasize the monitoring, triage, and analysis aspects that align with SOC workflows such as detection, triage, investigation, documentation, and escalation.
- **Specific Tools and Techniques:** Phrases like "SIEM logs," "PCAPs," and "network traffic patterns" reflect specific tools used in a lab environment, making it clear what evidence was analyzed.
- **Incident Response Focused:** Added tasks that involve incident response such as gathering evidence and documenting findings, which are key responsibilities for an entry-level SOC Analyst.

**ATS / SOC Keywords:**
- **Relevance to Job Description:** These keywords directly align with the technical expectations outlined in the target job description. For example, "SIEM" is explicitly mentioned in the job summary.
- **Technical Terms:** Including terms like "EDR/XDR," "network traffic analysis," and "vulnerability remediation" highlight a candidate's understanding of advanced security concepts.

These changes ensure that the resume directly addresses the key responsibilities and technical expectations for an entry-level SOC Analyst role, while maintaining clarity and relevance.
