**IT Support & Digital Literacy Assistant**
Academic / Volunteer Experience | Jan 2024 – Present

- Monitored and responded to security alerts from simulated SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tools, identifying and triaging incidents using documented procedures.
- Conducted initial triage of security events in a lab environment, classifying severity levels based on suspicious activity patterns observed in endpoint behavior.
- Analyzed DNS query logs and HTTP traffic captures to identify potential threats, such as unauthorized access attempts or unusual network connections.
- Assisted with incident response by gathering evidence from endpoints and networks, documenting findings and sharing them with the team for further analysis.
- Reviewed account activity, access changes, and system configurations in simulated lab environments to detect policy violations or malicious activities.

**Endpoint Troubleshooting & Maintenance Lab**

- Performed structured troubleshooting on Windows endpoints, diagnosing and resolving issues related to OS errors, misconfigurations, and user-impacting problems.
- Conducted routine maintenance tasks including operating system setup, patching, antivirus configuration, and basic security hardening in simulated environments.
- Applied preventative maintenance techniques to reduce recurring issues and improve system reliability through regular testing and analysis of endpoint behavior.
- Investigated common endpoint failures by isolating symptoms, identifying root causes, and validating fixes—mirroring SOC-style triage workflows.

**Digital Literacy & Endpoint Security Project**

- Designed and delivered basic computer security and internet safety training for first-time and non-technical users in a simulated lab environment.
- Configured antivirus software and implemented baseline OS security settings to enhance endpoint protection against common threats.
- Analyzed network traffic, DNS logs, and HTTP session data from PCAPs to detect suspicious activities and improve incident detection capabilities.
