### Revised Resume Bullets

1. **Detection**
   - Monitored security tools (SIEM, EDR/XDR, endpoint platforms) in simulated lab environments to identify and alert on suspicious activities.
   - Analyzed real-time network traffic using packet capture files (.pcap) to detect potential threats based on DNS, HTTP, and TCP session behavior.

2. **Triage**
   - Performed initial triage of security events by classifying severity levels based on predefined criteria from academic labs.
   - Developed a structured triage workflow that included isolating symptoms, identifying root causes, and validating fixes through detailed logs and system configurations.

3. **Investigation**
   - Conducted in-depth investigations into simulated incident scenarios to identify suspicious activities using OS and application logs, network traffic analysis, and endpoint forensic tools.
   - Analyzed log data from Windows operating systems to review account activity, access changes, and system configuration modifications.

4. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive documentation of findings during security events, including evidence-gathering procedures and step-by-step protocols for incident response.
   - Provided clear communication and concise reports on technical issues to non-technical stakeholders through written handouts and digital presentations.

5. **Escalation**
   - Escalated incidents requiring further analysis or action to senior team members by following established escalation procedures.
   - Collaborated with IT and security teams in simulated lab settings to improve detection and response protocols.

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Alignment with SOC Workflows:**
   - The rewritten bullets explicitly align with the SOC workflows of detection, triage, investigation, documentation, and escalation. This ensures that the experience is presented in a structured manner relevant to an entry-level cybersecurity role.

2. **Laboratory-Driven Evidence:**
   - Each bullet now includes specific examples from lab-based environments (e.g., using .pcap files for network traffic analysis). This demonstrates hands-on experience with real-world scenarios, making it easier for interviewers to validate the claims.

3. **Relevant Technical Skills:**
   - The inclusion of technical skills like SIEM, EDR/XDR, and packet capture analysis aligns with the role's expectations for monitoring and investigating security alerts.
   
4. **Communication and Documentation:**
   - Emphasizing clear communication and detailed documentation is crucial in SOC roles. The new bullets reflect this by highlighting the creation of comprehensive reports and handouts.

5. **Soft Skills and Technical Competencies:**
   - By focusing on both technical skills (e.g., network traffic analysis) and soft skills (e.g., clear communication), the revised resume ensures a well-rounded presentation that aligns with the job description's requirements.

This alignment enhances the candidacy for an entry-level SOC or junior cybersecurity analyst role by demonstrating practical, defensible experience in relevant areas.
