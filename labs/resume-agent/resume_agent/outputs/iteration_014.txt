### Explanation of Changes

**Revised Resume Bullets:**
- The revised bullets focus on the SOC workflows of detection, triage, investigation, documentation, and escalation, which aligns closely with the job description.
- The use of specific techniques like DNS, HTTP, TCP session analysis is emphasized to showcase hands-on experience in network traffic analysis, a key requirement for the role.
- Bullet points now include examples of how tasks were performed in a lab or simulated environment, providing evidence that can be verified.

**ATS / SOC Keywords:**
- These keywords are chosen based on the technical expectations and responsibilities outlined in the job description. They highlight skills related to security operations, incident response, and network analysis.
- The inclusion of specific terms like SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and EDR/XDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) demonstrates familiarity with tools commonly used in SOC environments.

By aligning the resume language and content with these changes, Christopher Cahall's experience is more clearly presented as relevant to an entry-level SOC analyst role.
