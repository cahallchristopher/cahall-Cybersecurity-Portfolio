### Explanation of Changes

**Alignment with Job Description:**
- **Revised Bullet Points**: The revised bullets now emphasize the SOC workflows such as monitoring, triage, and investigation using specific tools (DNS queries, HTTP requests) and techniques (TCP session logs), which are directly relevant to the role.
  
- **ATS/Keyword Integration**: Keywords like "Monitoring," "Triage," "Incident Response," and "Network Traffic Analysis" were included to ensure they align with what an ATS system would recognize. This increases the chances of your resume being selected for review by hiring managers.

**Improvement in Clarity:**
- The revised version provides more specific examples and context, making it clear how you have applied these skills in a lab-based setting. For instance, instead of just mentioning "endpoint security," the bullets detail specific actions like analyzing DNS queries and HTTP requests.
  
- **Clarity on Technical Skills**: Keywords such as "SIEM Tools" and "TCP Session Logs" demonstrate your familiarity with tools and techniques that are often used in SOC roles.

**Detail-Oriented Approach:**
- By focusing on specific technical activities (e.g., analyzing PCAP files, gathering evidence), the revised resume showcases a more detailed understanding of the role’s responsibilities. This makes it easier for an interviewer to understand how you would approach real-world scenarios if hired.
