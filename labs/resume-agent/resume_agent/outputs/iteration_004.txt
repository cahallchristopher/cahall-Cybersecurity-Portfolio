### Explanation of Changes

**Revised Resume Bullets:**
- **Alignment with Job Description:** The revised bullets specifically align with the responsibilities outlined in the target job description by emphasizing monitoring, triage, investigation, and documentation skills. This ensures that the experience is directly relevant to an entry-level SOC Analyst role.
- **Lab-Based Focus:** By using terms like "simulated," "lab settings," and "labs," we confirm that all experiences are within a controlled environment, avoiding any implication of production or enterprise experience.
- **Observational Language:** Using phrases such as "observed," "identified," and "analyzed" helps frame the work in an investigative context, mirroring SOC workflows.

**ATS / SOC Keywords:**
- These keywords directly correspond to skills and responsibilities required by the job description. They help the resume pass through ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) and highlight relevant experience for interviewers.
- **Specific Tools:** While avoiding tool names, terms like "SIEM," "EDR/XDR," and "vulnerability assessment" indicate familiarity with key security tools and processes.

By making these changes, the resume better aligns with the target role's expectations, ensuring a more compelling and relevant application.
