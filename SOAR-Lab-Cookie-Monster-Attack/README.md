# SOAR Lab: Cookie Monster Attack

This is a hands-on SOAR lab focused on detection and automated response.

A simulated attacker compromises a Windows endpoint.  
LimaCharlie EDR detects the activity and triggers response actions.

This lab is being built to practice real SOC workflows.

## What This Lab Covers

- Endpoint detection using LimaCharlie
- Automated response actions
- Command-and-control detection
- Credential access prevention
- Evidence collection

## Lab Environment

- VirtualBox
- Ubuntu Server (gateway)
- Windows 10 (EDR sensor)
- Kali Linux (attacker)

## Status
