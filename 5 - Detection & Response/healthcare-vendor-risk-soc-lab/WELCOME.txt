WELCOME — HEALTHCARE VENDOR RISK SOC LAB
======================================

This lab is intentionally quiet.

There are no exploits.
There is no malware.
Nothing dramatic happens.

That is the point.

--------------------------------------
WHAT THIS LAB IS ABOUT
--------------------------------------
Healthcare security failures often do not come from attackers
breaking in.

They come from:
• Over-trusted vendors
• Poor visibility
• Weak logging
• Assumptions that “someone else is watching”

This lab focuses on detection, auditing, and accountability
in environments where sensitive data must be protected.

--------------------------------------
HOW TO READ THIS LAB
--------------------------------------
Think like a SOC analyst.

Ask:
• What access exists?
• What activity is logged?
• What activity is NOT logged?
• How would we know if something went wrong?
• Could we explain this during an audit?

Each file in this lab answers one of those questions.

--------------------------------------
WHY HEALTHCARE
--------------------------------------
Healthcare environments are complex.
Third-party vendors are common.
Data sensitivity is high.
Compliance requirements are strict.

In many roles, HIPAA safeguards are not abstract rules.
They shape daily behavior, access decisions, and documentation.

This lab reflects that reality.

--------------------------------------
WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE
--------------------------------------
Success is not “finding an attack.”

Success is being able to say:
• We know what our vendors are doing
• We can trace access to logs
• We can detect abnormal behavior
• We can explain our controls clearly

--------------------------------------
INTENDED AUDIENCE
--------------------------------------
• Entry-level SOC analysts
• Security interns
• IT professionals moving into security
• Anyone learning to think defensively
