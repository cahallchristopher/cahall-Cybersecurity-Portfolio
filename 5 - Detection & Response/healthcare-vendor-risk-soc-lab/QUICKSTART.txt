HEALTHCARE VENDOR RISK SOC LAB — QUICKSTART
==========================================

This lab demonstrates how third-party vendor access can introduce
risk into healthcare environments when logging and monitoring
controls are weak or missing.

There is no malware.
There is no exploitation.
The risk comes from visibility gaps.

------------------------------------------
LAB PURPOSE
------------------------------------------
• Model healthcare vendor access risk
• Log and audit network behavior
• Generate SOC-style alerts
• Map technical controls to HIPAA safeguards
• Practice explaining detection logic clearly

------------------------------------------
LAB COMPONENTS
------------------------------------------
• Ubuntu Server
  - Acts as a secure gateway
  - Runs dnsmasq for DNS logging
  - Enforces basic firewall controls

• Windows System
  - Represents systems accessing patient data

• Vendor System (Kali or Linux)
  - Simulates third-party billing / service vendor
  - Access is limited but monitored

------------------------------------------
WHAT TO LOOK FOR
------------------------------------------
• Unexpected DNS queries
• Access outside approved domains
• Repeated external lookups
• Logging gaps that prevent attribution
• How alerts would surface in a SOC

------------------------------------------
WHY THIS MATTERS
------------------------------------------
Many healthcare breaches occur because vendors are trusted
but not monitored.

This lab focuses on detection, auditing, and accountability
rather than exploitation.
